# RP2040_AS3394
An AS3394 Voice Card controlled by RP2040.

Schematics and Routing in KiCad. Uses 30Khz PWM with 12-bit duty cycle and 1KHz Low Pass filtering to produce control voltages.

Mainly a way for me to learn and experiment with discrete Sallen-Key and MFB filters. Also a way to avoid out-of-stock DACs during the chip shortage.
